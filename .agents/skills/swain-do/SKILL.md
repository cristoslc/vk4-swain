# Execution Tracking

Abstraction layer for agent execution tracking. Other skills (e.g., swain-design) express intent using abstract terms; this skill translates that intent into concrete CLI commands.

**Before first use:** Read [skills/swain-do/references/tk-cheatsheet.md](skills/swain-do/references/tk-cheatsheet.md) for complete command syntax, flags, ID formats, and anti-patterns.

## Artifact handoff protocol

This skill receives handoffs from swain-design based on a four-tier tracking model:

| Tier | Artifacts | This skill's role |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Implementation** | SPEC | Create a tracked implementation plan and task breakdown before any code is written |
| **Coordination** | EPIC, VISION, JOURNEY | Do not track directly — swain-design decomposes these into children first, then hands off the children |
| **Research** | SPIKE | Create a tracked plan when the research is complex enough to benefit from task breakdown |
| **Reference** | ADR, PERSONA, RUNBOOK | No tracking expected |

If invoked directly on a coordination-tier artifact (EPIC, VISION, JOURNEY) without prior decomposition, defer to swain-design to create child SPECs first, then create plans for those children.

## Term mapping

Other skills use these abstract terms. This skill maps them to the current backend (`tk`):

| Abstract term | Meaning | tk command |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| **implementation plan** | Top-level container grouping all tasks for a spec artifact | `tk create "Title" -t epic --external-ref <SPEC-ID>` |
| **task** | An individual unit of work within a plan | `tk create "Title" -t task --parent <epic-id>` |
| **origin ref** | Immutable link from a plan to the spec that seeded it | `--external-ref <ID>` flag on epic creation |
| **spec tag** | Mutable tag linking a task to every spec it affects | `--tags spec:<ID>` on create |
| **dependency** | Ordering constraint between tasks | `tk dep <child> <parent>` (child depends on parent) |
| **ready work** | Unblocked tasks available for pickup | `tk ready` |
| **claim** | Atomically take ownership of a task | `tk claim <id>` |
| **complete** | Mark a task as done | `tk add-note <id> "reason"` then `tk close <id>` |
| **abandon** | Close a task that will not be completed | `tk add-note <id> "Abandoned: <why>"` then `tk close <id>` |
| **escalate** | Abandon + invoke swain-design to update upstream artifacts | Abandon, then invoke swain-design skill |

## Configuration and bootstrap

Config stored in `.agents/execution-tracking.vars.json` (created on first run). Read [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) for first-run setup questions, config keys, and the 6-step bootstrap workflow.

## Statuses

tk accepts exactly three status values: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`. Use the `status` command to set arbitrary statuses, but the dependency graph (`ready`, `blocked`) only evaluates these three.

To express abandonment, use `tk add-note <id> "Abandoned: ..."` then `tk close <id>` — see [Escalation](#escalation).

## Operating rules

1. **Always include `--description`** (or `-d`) when creating issues — a title alone loses the "why" behind a task. Future agents (or your future self) picking up this work need enough context to act without re-researching.
2. Create/update tasks at the start of work, after each major milestone, and before final response — this keeps the tracker useful as a live dashboard rather than a post-hoc record.
3. Keep task titles short and action-oriented — they appear in `tk ready` output, tree views, and notifications where space is limited.
4. Store handoff notes using `tk add-note <id> "context"` rather than ephemeral chat context — chat history is lost between sessions, but task notes persist and are visible to any agent or observer.
5. Include references to related artifact IDs in tags (e.g., `spec:SPEC-003`) — this enables querying all work touching a given spec.
6. **Prefix abandonment reasons with `Abandoned:`** when closing incomplete tasks — this convention makes abandoned work findable so nothing silently disappears.
7. **Use `ticket-query` for structured output** — when you need JSON for programmatic use, pipe through `ticket-query` (available in the vendored `bin/` directory) instead of parsing human-readable output. Example: `ticket-query '.status == "open"'`

<!-- swain-model-hint: opus, effort: high — plan creation and code implementation require deep reasoning -->
## TDD enforcement

Strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with anti-rationalization safeguards and completion verification. Read [references/tdd-enforcement.md](references/tdd-enforcement.md) for the anti-rationalization table, task ordering rules, and evidence requirements.

## Spec lineage tagging

Use `--external-ref SPEC-NNN` on plan epics (immutable origin) and `--tags spec:SPEC-NNN` on child tasks (mutable). Query: `ticket-query '.tags and (.tags | contains("spec:SPEC-003"))'`. Cross-plan links: `tk link <task-a> <task-b>`.

## Escalation

When work cannot proceed as designed, abandon tasks and escalate to swain-design. Read [references/escalation.md](references/escalation.md) for the triage table, abandonment commands, escalation workflow, and cross-spec handling.

## "What's next?" flow

Run `tk ready` for unblocked tasks and `ticket-query '.status == "in_progress"'` for in-flight work. If `.tickets/` is empty or missing, defer to `bash "$(find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" -path '*/swain-design/scripts/chart.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" ready` for artifact-level guidance.

## Context on claim

When claiming a task tagged with `spec:<ID>`, show the Vision ancestry breadcrumb to provide strategic context. Run `bash "$(find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" -path '*/swain-design/scripts/chart.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" scope <SPEC-ID> 2>/dev/null | head -5` to display the parent chain. This tells the agent/operator how the current task connects to project strategy.

## Artifact/tk reconciliation

When specwatch detects mismatches (`TK_SYNC`, `TK_ORPHAN` in `.agents/specwatch.log`), read [references/reconciliation.md](references/reconciliation.md) for the mismatch types, resolution commands, and reconciliation workflow.

## Session bookmark

After state-changing operations, update the bookmark: `bash "$(find . .claude .agents -path '*/swain-session/scripts/swain-bookmark.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" "<action> <task-description>"`

## Superpowers skill chaining

When superpowers is installed, swain-do invokes these skills at specific points. Skipping them or inlining the work undermines the guarantees they provide — TDD catches regressions before they compound, and verification prevents false completion claims that waste downstream effort:

1. **Before writing code for any task:** Invoke the `test-driven-development` skill. Write a failing test first (RED), then make it pass (GREEN), then refactor. This applies to every task, not just the first one.

2. **When dispatching parallel work:** Invoke `subagent-driven-development` (if subagents are available and tasks are independent) or `executing-plans` (if serial). Read [references/execution-strategy.md](references/execution-strategy.md) for the decision tree.

3. **Before claiming any task or plan is complete:** Invoke `verification-before-completion`. Run the verification commands, read the output, and only then assert success. No completion claims without fresh evidence.

**Detection:** `ls .agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md .claude/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null` — if at least one path exists, superpowers is available. Cache the result for the session.

When superpowers is NOT installed, swain-do uses its built-in TDD enforcement (see [references/tdd-enforcement.md](references/tdd-enforcement.md)) and serial execution.

## Plan ingestion (superpowers integration)

When a superpowers plan file exists, use the ingestion script (`skills/swain-do/scripts/ingest-plan.py`) instead of manual task decomposition. Read [references/plan-ingestion.md](references/plan-ingestion.md) for usage, format requirements, and when NOT to use it.

## Execution strategy

Selects serial vs. subagent-driven execution based on superpowers availability and task complexity. Read [references/execution-strategy.md](references/execution-strategy.md) for the decision tree, detection commands, and worktree-artifact mapping.

## Pre-plan implementation detection

Before creating a plan for a SPEC, scan for evidence that it's already implemented. This avoids re-implementing work that exists on unmerged branches or was done in a prior session. Run these checks in parallel — they're independent signals that feed a single decision.

### Signal scan

| Signal | Check | Why it matters |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Unmerged branches** | `git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:trackshort)' refs/heads/ \| grep -i "<SPEC-ID>"` then verify not merged: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> HEAD` | Worktree branches from prior sessions are the strongest signal — they contain commits that never reached trunk. Discovering this mid-plan-creation is disruptive; catching it here is cheap. |
| **Git history** | `git log --oneline --all \| grep -i "<SPEC-ID>"` | Commits referencing the spec ID indicate implementation happened somewhere in the repo's history. |
| **Deliverable files** | Read the spec to identify described outputs (scripts, modules, configs). Check whether they exist on HEAD via `ls` or Glob. | Files on disk without matching commits may indicate partial or uncommitted work. |
| **Tests pass** | Re-run the spec's tests now and read the output. Prior results are not evidence — only fresh execution counts. | This is the critical gate. Agents are prone to rationalizing that "tests passed before" without re-running. The reason this matters: code changes between sessions can silently break previously-passing tests. |

### Decision

- **2+ signals** → take the retroactive-close path (below)
- **1 signal** → proceed with normal plan creation; note the signal in the first task's description
- **0 signals** → proceed normally

### Retroactive-close path

When evidence confirms prior implementation, skip full task decomposition:

1. Create a single tracking task: `tk create "Retroactive verification: <SPEC-ID>" -t task --external-ref <SPEC-ID>`
2. Claim it: `tk claim <id>`
3. Run `verification-before-completion` (if superpowers installed) or re-run the spec's tests manually.
4. If verification passes: add a note with the evidence, close the task, then invoke swain-design to transition the spec to Complete.
5. If verification fails: fall back to normal plan creation — the prior implementation was incomplete.

## Worktree isolation preamble

Implementation work happens in a worktree so that concurrent agents don't collide on shared files and half-finished changes stay off trunk until verified. Before any implementation or execution operation (plan creation, task claim, code writing, execution handoff), run this detection:

```bash
GIT_COMMON=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null)
[ "$GIT_COMMON" != "$GIT_DIR" ] && IN_WORKTREE=yes || IN_WORKTREE=no
```

**Read-only operations** (`tk ready`, `tk show`, status checks, task queries) skip this check entirely — proceed in the current context.

**If `IN_WORKTREE=yes`:** already isolated. Proceed normally.

**If `IN_WORKTREE=no`** (main worktree) and the operation is implementation or execution:

1. Use the `EnterWorktree` tool to create an isolated worktree. This is the only mechanism that actually changes the agent's working directory — manual `git worktree add` + `cd` does not persist across tool calls.

2. After entering, re-run tab naming to reflect the new branch:
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
   bash "$(find "$REPO_ROOT" -path '*/swain-session/scripts/swain-tab-name.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" --path "$(pwd)" --auto
   ```

3. If **`EnterWorktree` fails** — stop. Surface the error to the operator. Do not begin implementation work.

**Note:** swain-session auto-enters a worktree at startup (Step 1.5), so this preamble is a fallback for sessions that skipped isolation or where the operator exited the worktree mid-session.

When all tasks in the plan complete, or when the operator requests, run the plan completion handoff (see below) before exiting the worktree.

## Plan completion and handoff

When all tasks under a plan epic are closed (or the operator declares the work done), execute this chain **before** exiting the worktree. This ensures retros, SPEC transitions, and EPIC cascades fire consistently.

### Step 1 — Detect plan completion

```bash
TK_BIN="$(find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" -path '*/swain-do/bin/tk' -print -quit 2>/dev/null | xargs dirname 2>/dev/null)"
export PATH="$TK_BIN:$PATH"
# Check if any tasks under the plan epic are still open
OPEN_COUNT=$(ticket-query ".parent == \"<epic-id>\" and .status != \"closed\"" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
```

If `OPEN_COUNT > 0`, the plan is not complete — continue working or ask the operator. If `OPEN_COUNT == 0`, proceed.

### Step 2 — Invoke swain-design for SPEC transition

Identify the SPEC linked to the plan epic (via `--external-ref`):

```bash
tk show <epic-id> 2>/dev/null  # external_ref field contains the SPEC ID
```

Invoke **swain-design** to transition the SPEC forward. The target phase depends on the spec's current state and whether verification is complete:
- If all acceptance criteria have evidence → transition to `Complete`
- If acceptance criteria need manual verification → transition to `Needs Manual Test`
- If implementation is done but untested → transition to `In Progress` (if not already)

swain-design handles the downstream chain automatically:
- Checks whether the parent EPIC should also transition (all child SPECs complete → EPIC Complete)
- If the EPIC reaches a terminal state → invokes **swain-retro** to capture the retrospective

### Step 3 — Offer merge and cleanup

After the SPEC transition completes, offer to merge and clean up:

> All tasks closed. SPEC-NNN transitioned to {phase}. Merge this branch into {base-branch} and clean up the worktree?

If the operator accepts:
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Call `ExitWorktree` to return to the main checkout
3. The worktree cleanup is handled by the ExitWorktree tool

If the operator declines, call `ExitWorktree` without merging — the branch is preserved for later.

### Skipping the chain

The operator can say "just exit" or "skip the handoff" to bypass steps 2–3 and go directly to `ExitWorktree`. Log a note on the plan epic: `tk add-note <epic-id> "Exited worktree without completion handoff"`.

## Fallback

If `tk` cannot be found or is unavailable:

1. Log the failure reason.
2. Fall back to a neutral text task ledger (JSONL or Markdown checklist) in the working directory.
3. Use the same status model (`open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`) and keep updates externally visible.
