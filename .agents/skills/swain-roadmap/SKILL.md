# Roadmap

Regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from the artifact graph and opens it. The heavy lifting is done by `chart.sh roadmap` in swain-design — this skill is the user-facing entry point.

## When invoked

### 1. Locate chart.sh

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
CHART_SH="$(find "$REPO_ROOT" -path '*/swain-design/scripts/chart.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
```

If `chart.sh` is not found, tell the user swain-design is not installed and stop.

### 2. Regenerate roadmap

Parse the argument: if the user provided an artifact ID (e.g., `swain-roadmap VISION-001`), set `SCOPE_ID` to that ID. Otherwise, `SCOPE_ID` is empty.

**If `SCOPE_ID` is set:**

```bash
bash "$CHART_SH" roadmap --scope "$SCOPE_ID"
```

This writes a `roadmap.md` to the scoped artifact's folder.

**If `SCOPE_ID` is empty:**

```bash
bash "$CHART_SH" roadmap
```

This writes `ROADMAP.md` to the project root AND regenerates all per-Vision and per-Initiative `roadmap.md` slices in their respective artifact folders.

The project-wide ROADMAP.md contains:
- **Quadrant chart** — priority matrix as PNG (falls back to inline Mermaid if `mmdc` is unavailable)
- **Legend** — epics grouped by quadrant with short IDs
- **Eisenhower tables** — Do First / Schedule / In Progress / Backlog with progress, unblock counts, and operator decision needs
- **Gantt timeline** — priority-staggered schedule with dependency links
- **Dependency graph** — blocking relationships across priority boundaries (only if dependencies exist)

Each per-artifact slice contains: intent summary, child artifact table with links and progress, aggregate progress bar, recent git commits, and an Eisenhower priority subset.

### 2.5. Post-process intent placeholders

After chart.sh completes, scan the output file(s) for `{{INTENT: <ID>}}` placeholders. For each:

1. Read the source artifact markdown.
2. Extract the first sentence of `## Value Proposition` (for Visions) or `## Goal / Objective` (for Initiatives).
3. Replace the `{{INTENT: <ID>}}` marker with the extracted sentence.
4. Write the file back.

If the section cannot be found, leave the placeholder as-is (the operator can fill it in manually or wait for `brief-description` frontmatter to be populated via SPEC-144).

### 3. Open the roadmap

If `SCOPE_ID` was set, open the scoped slice. Look up the artifact's file path from the graph cache to find its folder:

```bash
ARTIFACT_FILE="$(bash "$CHART_SH" show "$SCOPE_ID" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'docs/[^ ]+' | head -1)"
if [ -n "$ARTIFACT_FILE" ]; then
    open "$REPO_ROOT/$(dirname "$ARTIFACT_FILE")/roadmap.md"
fi
```

If no scope, open the project-wide roadmap:

```bash
open "$REPO_ROOT/ROADMAP.md"
```

Always open the rendered file so the operator gets the full view with charts and diagrams. Never tell the operator to open it themselves — just do it.

### 4. Show CLI summary

ROADMAP.md contains tables, Mermaid diagrams, and image references that do not render in a terminal. Use the `--cli` flag to get a pre-formatted plain text summary:

```bash
bash "$CHART_SH" roadmap --cli
```

This outputs a deterministic, aligned summary grouped by Eisenhower quadrant (Do First, Schedule, In Progress, Backlog), with all first-degree children (EPICs, SPECs, SPIKEs) nested under their parent initiative. Show this output directly — do not reformat or filter it.

Say "ROADMAP.md refreshed and opened." before the CLI output. For scoped runs, say "Roadmap slice for {SCOPE_ID} refreshed and opened." instead.

### 6. Focus lane context

If a focus lane is set in `.agents/session.json`, mention it at the end.

```bash
FOCUS="$(bash "$(find "$REPO_ROOT" -path '*/swain-session/scripts/swain-focus.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null)"
```

If focus is set, note: "Focus: {FOCUS}. Use swain-status for focus-scoped recommendations."

## Freshness check (for other skills)

Other skills (like swain-status) can call chart.sh directly for staleness-based regeneration. This skill always regenerates unconditionally — it is the "force refresh" path.

## Error handling

- If chart.sh fails, show the error output and suggest running `swain-doctor`
- If ROADMAP.md exists but chart.sh is unavailable, show the existing (possibly stale) file with a staleness warning
- Never fail hard — show whatever is available
