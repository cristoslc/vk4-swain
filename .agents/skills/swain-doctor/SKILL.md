# Doctor

Session-start health checks for swain projects. Validates and repairs health across **all** swain skills — governance, tools, directories, settings, scripts, caches, and runtime state. Auto-migrates stale `.beads/` directories to `.tickets/` and removes them. Idempotent — run it every session; it only writes when repairs are needed.

Run checks in the order listed below. Collect all findings into a summary table at the end.

## Preflight integration

A lightweight shell script (`swain-preflight.sh`, located via `find "$REPO_ROOT" -path '*/swain-doctor/scripts/swain-preflight.sh'`) performs quick checks before invoking the full doctor. If preflight exits 0, swain-doctor is skipped for the session. If it exits 1, swain-doctor runs normally.

The preflight checks are a subset of this skill's checks — governance files, .agents directory, .tickets health, script permissions. It runs as pure bash with zero agent tokens. See AGENTS.md § Session startup for the invocation flow.

When invoked directly by the user (not via the auto-invoke flow), swain-doctor always runs regardless of preflight status.

## Session-start governance check

1. Detect the agent platform and locate the context file:

   | Platform | Context file | Detection |
   |----------|-------------|-----------|
   | Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` (project root) | Default — use if no other platform detected |
   | Cursor | `.cursor/rules/swain-governance.mdc` | `.cursor/` directory exists |

2. Check whether governance rules are already present:

   ```bash
   grep -l "swain governance" CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md .cursor/rules/swain-governance.mdc 2>/dev/null
   ```

   If any file matches, governance is installed. Check freshness (step 3), then proceed to [Legacy skill cleanup](#legacy-skill-cleanup).

3. If governance markers found, check freshness:

   Extract the block between `<!-- swain governance` and `<!-- end swain governance -->` from the installed context file. Compare against the canonical source at `skills/swain-doctor/references/AGENTS.content.md` (same extraction, excluding marker lines).

   ```bash
   extract_gov() { awk '/<!-- swain governance/{f=1;next}/<!-- end swain governance/{f=0}f' "$1"; }
   INSTALLED_HASH=$(extract_gov "$GOV_FILE" | shasum -a 256 | cut -d' ' -f1)
   CANONICAL_HASH=$(extract_gov "skills/swain-doctor/references/AGENTS.content.md" | shasum -a 256 | cut -d' ' -f1)
   ```

   - **ok** — hashes match. Governance is current. Proceed to [Legacy skill cleanup](#legacy-skill-cleanup).
   - **stale** — hashes differ. Proceed to [Governance replacement](#governance-replacement) before Legacy skill cleanup.

4. If no marker match in step 2 (governance missing), run [Legacy skill cleanup](#legacy-skill-cleanup), then proceed to [Governance injection](#governance-injection).

## Legacy skill cleanup

Clean up renamed and retired skill directories using fingerprint checks. Read [references/legacy-cleanup.md](references/legacy-cleanup.md) for the full procedure. Data source: `skills/swain-doctor/references/legacy-skills.json`.

## Platform dotfolder cleanup

Remove dotfolder stubs (`.windsurf/`, `.cursor/`, etc.) for agent platforms that are not installed. Read [references/platform-cleanup.md](references/platform-cleanup.md) for the detection and cleanup procedure. Requires `jq`.

## Governance injection

Inject governance rules into the platform context file when missing. Read [references/governance-injection.md](references/governance-injection.md) for Claude Code and Cursor injection procedures. Source: `skills/swain-doctor/references/AGENTS.content.md`.

## Governance replacement

Replace a stale governance block with the current canonical version. Read [references/governance-injection.md § Stale governance replacement](references/governance-injection.md) for the replacement procedure. This runs when freshness check (step 3) detects a hash mismatch.

## Tickets directory validation

Validates `.tickets/` health — YAML frontmatter, stale locks. **Skip if `.tickets/` does not exist.** Read [references/tickets-validation.md](references/tickets-validation.md) for the full procedure.

## Stale .beads/ migration and cleanup

Auto-migrates `.beads/` → `.tickets/` if present. Skip if `.beads/` does not exist. Read [references/beads-migration.md](references/beads-migration.md) for the migration procedure.

## Governance content reference

The canonical governance rules live in `skills/swain-doctor/references/AGENTS.content.md`. Both swain-doctor and swain-init read from this single source of truth. If the upstream rules change in a future swain release, update that file and bump the skill version. The freshness check (step 3 of the governance check) will automatically detect the mismatch and offer replacement on the next session.

## Tool availability

Check required (`git`, `jq`) and optional (`tk`, `uv`, `gh`, `tmux`, `fswatch`) tools. Never install automatically. Read [references/tool-availability.md](references/tool-availability.md) for the check commands, degradation notes, and reporting format.

## Runtime checks

Memory directory, settings validation, script permissions, `.agents` directory, status cache bootstrap, and SSH alias readiness. Read [references/runtime-checks.md](references/runtime-checks.md) for the full procedures and bash commands.

## tk health (extended .tickets checks)

Verify vendored tk is executable at `skills/swain-do/bin/tk` and check for stale lock files. **Skip if `.tickets/` does not exist.** See [references/tickets-validation.md](references/tickets-validation.md) for details.

## swain-box symlink

Ensure `./swain-box` exists as a symlink to the installed `swain-box` script so operators can launch Docker Sandboxes from the project root. The script is distributed inside the swain skill tree at `*/swain/scripts/swain-box`. **Skip if the script cannot be found.**

### Detection

```bash
SWAIN_BOX_SCRIPT=$(find . .claude .agents -path '*/swain/scripts/swain-box' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$SWAIN_BOX_SCRIPT" ]; then
  # Get relative path from project root
  SWAIN_BOX_REL=$(python3 -c "import os,sys; print(os.path.relpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$SWAIN_BOX_SCRIPT" 2>/dev/null || echo "$SWAIN_BOX_SCRIPT")
  if [ -L swain-box ] && [ "$(readlink swain-box)" = "$SWAIN_BOX_REL" ]; then
    echo "ok"
  elif [ -e swain-box ] && [ ! -L swain-box ]; then
    echo "conflict"  # a real file named swain-box exists — do not overwrite
  else
    echo "missing"
  fi
fi
```

### Remediation

- **ok** — silent, no output.
- **missing** — create the symlink automatically:
  ```bash
  ln -sf "$SWAIN_BOX_REL" swain-box
  ```
  Report: `swain-box symlink created (./swain-box → $SWAIN_BOX_REL)`
- **conflict** — warn: `./swain-box exists but is not a symlink — skipping. To fix manually: rm swain-box && ln -sf <path> swain-box`

### Status values

- **ok** — symlink present and correct
- **repaired** — symlink created
- **warning** — conflict (real file); manual action needed

## Lifecycle directory migration

Detect old phase directories from before ADR-003's three-track normalization. Read [references/lifecycle-migration.md](references/lifecycle-migration.md) for detection commands, remediation steps, and status values.

## Superpowers detection

Check whether superpowers skills are installed:

```bash
SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS="brainstorming writing-plans test-driven-development verification-before-completion subagent-driven-development executing-plans"
found=0
missing=0
missing_names=""
for skill in $SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS; do
  if ls .agents/skills/$skill/SKILL.md .claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -q .; then
    found=$((found + 1))
  else
    missing=$((missing + 1))
    missing_names="$missing_names $skill"
  fi
done
```

### Status values and response

- **ok** — all superpowers skills detected. No output.
- **partial** — some skills present, some missing. List the missing ones, then prompt (see below). A partial install may indicate a failed update — note this in the prompt.
- **missing** — no superpowers skills found. Prompt the user.

**When status is `missing` or `partial`**, ask:

> Superpowers (`obra/superpowers`) is not installed [or: partially installed — N of 6 skills missing]. It provides TDD, brainstorming, plan writing, and verification skills that swain chains into during implementation and design work.
>
> Install superpowers now? (yes/no)

If the user says **yes**:
```bash
npx skills add obra/superpowers
```
Report success or failure. On success, update status to **ok**.

If the user says **no**, note "Superpowers: skipped" and continue. They can install later: `npx skills add obra/superpowers`.

Superpowers is strongly recommended but not required. Declining is always allowed.

## Stale worktree detection

Enumerate all linked worktrees and classify their health. **Skip if the repo has no linked worktrees.** Read [references/worktree-detection.md](references/worktree-detection.md) for the detection commands, classification rules, and status values.

## Epics without parent-initiative (migration advisory)

This is a non-blocking advisory check. It does not gate any other checks.

### Detection

```bash
# Find Active EPICs that have a parent-vision but no parent-initiative field
grep -rl "parent-vision:" docs/epic/ 2>/dev/null | while read f; do
  if ! grep -q "parent-initiative:" "$f"; then
    echo "$f"
  fi
done
```

### Response

If any EPICs are found without `parent-initiative`:

> **Advisory:** N Epic(s) have a `parent-vision` but no `parent-initiative`. The INITIATIVE artifact type is now available as a mid-level container between Vision and Epic. Adding `parent-initiative` links is optional but recommended for projects using prioritization features (`specgraph recommend`, `specgraph decision-debt`).
>
> To add the link, edit each Epic's frontmatter and add:
> ```yaml
> parent-initiative: INITIATIVE-NNN
> ```
>
> This check is informational — no action required. To run the guided migration, ask: "how do I fix the initiative migration?" or "run the initiative migration".

### Guided migration workflow

Read [references/initiative-migration.md](references/initiative-migration.md) for the full 6-step guided migration workflow (scan, cluster, create initiatives, re-parent, set weights, verify).

### Status values

- **ok** — all Active EPICs already have `parent-initiative`, or no EPICs exist
- **advisory** — one or more Active EPICs lack `parent-initiative` (non-blocking)

## Evidence Pool → Trove Migration

Detect unmigrated evidence pools:
- If `docs/evidence-pools/` exists: warn and offer to run migration
- If any artifact frontmatter contains `evidence-pool:`: warn and offer migration
- If both `docs/troves/` and `docs/evidence-pools/` exist: warn about incomplete migration

Migration script: `bash "$(find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" -path '*/swain-search/scripts/migrate-to-troves.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"`
Dry run first: `bash "$(find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" -path '*/swain-search/scripts/migrate-to-troves.sh' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)" --dry-run`

## Summary report

After all checks complete, output a concise summary table:

```
swain-doctor summary:
  Governance ......... ok
  Legacy cleanup ..... ok (nothing to clean)
  Platform dotfolders  ok (nothing to clean)
  .tickets/ .......... ok
  Stale .beads/ ...... ok (not present)
  Tools .............. ok (1 optional missing: fswatch)
  Memory directory ... ok
  Settings ........... ok
  Script permissions . ok
  .agents directory .. ok
  Status cache ....... seeded
  tk health .......... ok
  Lifecycle dirs ..... ok
  Epics w/o initiative advisory (3 epics — see note below)
  Worktrees .......... ok
  Superpowers ........ ok (6/6 skills detected)

3 checks performed repairs. 0 issues remain.
```

Use these status values:
- **ok** — nothing to do
- **repaired** — issue found and fixed automatically
- **warning** — issue found, user action recommended (give specifics)
- **skipped** — check could not run (e.g., jq missing for JSON validation)

If any checks have warnings, list them below the table with remediation steps.
