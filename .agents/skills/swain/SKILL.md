description: "Meta-router for swain skills. Invoke when the user explicitly asks swain to do something — not merely when they mention the project by name. Routes to the matching swain-* sub-skill — only load the one that matches. If the user's intent matches multiple rows, pick the most specific match. Sub-skills that are not installed will gracefully no-op."

<!-- swain-model-hint: haiku, effort: low -->
Invoke the Skill tool for exactly one match. Pass the user's full prompt as args.

**Disambiguation:** When the user's intent includes an artifact type name (spec, epic, ADR, spike, vision, initiative, journey, persona, runbook, design) alongside a question word (how, what, why), prefer **swain-design** over **swain-help**. swain-help is for meta-questions about swain itself, not for artifact operations.
